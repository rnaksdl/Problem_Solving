How to run my code by downloading the zipped folder:
	1. Download the zipped folder and unzip it.
	2. Make sure that you're in the 'project1' directory that you just downloaded in terminal
	3. You can see that in the directory, there're three files (project1.c, README.md, and 'Report.docx')
		'project1.c' file is the C program that I coded.
		'README.md' file the file that you are reading now.
		''Report.docx' file is the report that I wrote.
	4. You can compile the 'project1.c'
		by "gcc project1.c -o project1_output"
	5. Check the 'project1_output'
		by "./project1_output"

How to run my code in gpel8:

	2. You can see that in the directory, there're two files (project1.c and project1_output)
		'project1.c' file is the C program that I coded.
		'project1_output' is the output file from 'project1.c'. 
	3. You can compile the 'project1.c'
		by "gcc project1.c -o project1_output"
